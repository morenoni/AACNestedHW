Overview:

This project models a simple augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device, focusing on a symbol-based interface that helps users with speech impairments communicate. The AAC consists of two levels of images: a home screen with category images and a second level displaying items within each category. When an image is selected, the corresponding text is spoken aloud. The project uses the `AACCategory` class to represent individual categories and `AACMapping` to manage the image-to-category mappings and interactions. The device is built to support operations like adding new items, selecting images, and navigating between categories or resetting to the home screen. The project emphasizes the importance of accessible communication technology, ensuring users can interact with the AAC efficiently.
